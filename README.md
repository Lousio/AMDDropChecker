# AMDDropChecker
Easy Python Script that checks Digital River links and pings on Discord

You need to run it with 2 different instances. First run the discordbot.py and make sure it is ready by waiting for "{BOTNAME} has connected to Discord!". Once that shows up,
you can run the main.py. 

You can change the time period between checks. 

Future changes:
Make it possible to choose which GPU's to look for by CLI arguments

DOES NOT WORK DUE TO AMD PATCHING THE LINKS
